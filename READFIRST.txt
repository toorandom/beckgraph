/*

Builds a spirograph based in the internal radius and iterations given in argv.
This software supports random colors or gradient colors, random colors wont work on Windows Machines
It can combine several spirographs

The opengl window will show you both discs (external and internal on the right if just one spirograph selected)

it will also show you the points of the internal radius being drawn

The software requirements are OpenGL and Glut

in linux I compile

gcc -O2 -lGL -lglut -lGLU beckgraph.c -o beckgraph

Usage:


if you want to combine 2 spirographs, use the following command:

./beckgraph 30,20 20,10  

30,20 means that the first spirograph will have 30 as its internal radius  and
beckgraph will draw 20 curves using 20 points of the internal radius

20,10 is the same, with different values, the result will be 2 overlapped
spirographs

If you want random colors (I did not like my random colors but you can try)

./beckgraph 30,20 20,10 -r

If you want to overlap more spirographs, use the same logic
